The dataset “early_january_weather” has 15 variables: \* origin (weather
station) \* year, month, day, hour (time of recording) \* temp, dewp
(temperature and dewpoint in F) \* humid (relative humidity) \*
wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust (wind direction (in degrees), speed and
gust speed (in mph)) \* precip (precipitation in inches) \* pressure
(sea level pressure in millibars) \* visib (visibility in miles) \*
time_hour (date and hour of the recording)

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

The plot shows an increasing trend in temperature overall over the the
course of the two week period. The temperature cycles up and down with
the hours following the day and night cycles. There appears to be a cold
period in the days approaching January 14th where the highs of the
temperatures are lower and there is less spread between the highs and
lows in the temperature points for the day.
